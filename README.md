#  Program 2 - MPLS Dog Boarding Cost Calculator

The MPLS Dog Boarding Company in North Minneapolis is a dog day care facility that is looking for a developer that will implement functionality that will determine the cost of boarding based on information entered by client. The application will ask for the **name**, **breed**, **age**, **weight**, and the **number of days** the dog will need care.  Once all information is received, the application will generate a summary of estimated cost.

The application should accomplish 3 things

1. Display a bill containing all the input data as well as the daily day care fee, which is $45 for dogs under 15 pounds, $65 for dogs from 15 to 30 pounds inclusive, $85 for dogs from 31 to 80 pounds inclusive, and $100 for dogs over 81 pounds. If the dog ownerâ€™s fee is greater than $165, output a message that notify the dog owner that a 2% discount will be applied to the overall bill.

2. Determine which boarding group the dog will be assigned to based on age of dog.  If dog is 0, the dog will be in dog boarding ground BLUE, age 1 - 4 inclusively will be in group ORANGE, if age 5 group RED, and ages between 6 and 15 will be in dog boarding group GREEN.  

3. Generate output that provides a summary of Dog information along with estimated cost and assigned boarding group.
