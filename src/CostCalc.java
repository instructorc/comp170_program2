    Program 2: MPLS Dog Boarding Cost Estimate
    The MPLS Dog Boarding Company in North Minneapolis is a dog day care facility that is 
    looking for a developer that will implement functionality that will determine the cost 
    of boarding fee based on information entered by client. The application will ask for the 
    name, breed, age, the number of days the dog will need care, and weight of the dog. Once 
    all information is received, the application will generate a estimate that provides the 
    estimated cost of stay, the dog's name, age, number or days, weight and boarding group.  
    The boarding group is based on the dog's age.

    
	
	There will be five requirements for Program 1
	Requirement 1 - Variables are properly declared and initialized; Use of Scanner Object to read 
                    input from console. Make use of constant final variables. When possible, make 
                    sure to declare all variables that will hold data
                    
	Requirement 2 - Input/Output of all necessary information; Correct calculation including 2% discount.
                    
    Requirement 3 - Proper structures used to determine calculated outcome and dog's boarding group; Correct Operators
    Requirement 4 - Style - Proper use of comments, spacing, in program; use of
                    descriptive variable names
    Requirement 5 - Program is submitted by the due date listed and pushed to assigned GitHub Repository; 
                    Repository contains a minimum of three commits.
